Based on the classification accuracy shown in the table for Model 1 and Model 2, let's consider the expected performance on unseen instances (generalization) and then integrate the information about the overall accuracy when the models are tested on the entire dataset.

(a) Initially, one might expect Model 2 to have better generalization on unseen instances since it has a higher accuracy on Dataset B, which is used for testing (0.8 for Model 2 versus 0.72 for Model 1). Model 1 seems to be overfitting to Dataset A, indicated by its high accuracy on the training set (0.98) but significantly lower performance on the test set.

(b) After testing on the entire dataset (A + B), Model 1 has an accuracy of 0.85, while Model 2 has an accuracy of 0.81. This new piece of information suggests that Model 1, despite its initial appearance of overfitting, actually performs better overall when considering both datasets combined. The higher overall accuracy indicates that Model 1 is likely a better classifier for the entire dataset.

Therefore, based on the new information, Model 1 would be the final choice for classification as it has shown higher accuracy on the combined dataset, indicating better generalization than what was initially assumed from the separate dataset accuracies.

Both Minimum Description Length (MDL) and the pessimistic error estimate are methods used to prevent overfitting in the context of decision trees by considering the complexity of the model.

Similarity:

Both MDL and pessimistic error estimates aim to improve the generalization ability of decision trees by penalizing complexity. They try to balance the fit of the model to the training data with the complexity of the model to prevent overfitting. This is achieved by adding a complexity term to the loss function, which helps in selecting a more parsimonious model.
Difference:

The main difference lies in their approach to incorporating complexity. MDL is based on information theory and seeks to minimize the total description length of the model (which includes both the length needed to describe the tree and the length to describe the errors made by the tree on the training data). The pessimistic error estimate, on the other hand, adjusts the tree's error rate on the training set by adding a penalty for the number of leaves in the tree, based on statistical confidence bounds. It assumes that the actual error rate is likely to be worse than observed on the training set, especially for trees with many leaves.
